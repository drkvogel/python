A metaclass is the class of a class. 
A class defines how an instance of the class (i.e. an object) behaves while a metaclass defines how a class behaves. 
A class is an instance of a metaclass.

type is the usual metaclass in Python. type is itself a class, and it is its own type. You won't be able to recreate something like type purely in Python, but Python cheats a little. To create your own metaclass in Python you really just want to subclass type.

### `object` pre-defined variable

```py
>>> object
<class 'object'>
>>> type(object)
<class 'type'>
```
