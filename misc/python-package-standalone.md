ah, but they mean *install Python* with that envvar - e.g. with `pyenv` as they've done, but mine is installed via asdf

where is pyinstaller installed now?

‚ùØ which -a pyinstaller
/Users/kvogel/.asdf/shims/pyinstaller
```
so pyinstaller was installed to the asdf env, which doesn't have the dev libs...

oh, this is too much, now, and low low priority...
lets put this folder under general.git so I can reference it for later
