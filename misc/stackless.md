>Both 'pypy' and 'gevent' are supposed to provide high performance. Pypy is supposedly faster than CPython, while gevent is based on co-routines and greenlets, which supposedly makes for a faster web server.

### greenlets

[greenlet: Lightweight concurrent programming — greenlet 0.4.0 documentation ](https://greenlet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
> The “greenlet” package is a spin-off of Stackless, a version of CPython that supports micro-threads called “tasklets”. 

### gevent

[What is gevent? — gevent 1.5a4.dev0 documentation ](http://www.gevent.org/)
