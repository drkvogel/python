>It's an excellent book teaching you many things at once - Django, test-driven development, git usage, and web scraping as well. 

> the journey I’ve taken from "hacking" to "software engineering". It’s mainly about testing, but there’s a lot more to it, as you’ll soon see.
>hey say that in any discipline, you go from apprentice, to journeyman, and eventually, sometimes, on to master.

[journeyman - definition, etymology and usage, examples and related words ](http://www.finedictionary.com/journeyman.html)
Journeyman A competent and experienced worker who performs adequately but without a high level of expertise or imagination.
Journeyman Formerly, a man hired to work by the day; now, commonly, one who has finished an apprenticeship and is a competent worker in a handicraft or trade, but has not received recognition as a master; -- distinguished from apprentice and from master workman.
"I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men, and not made them well."

TDD? It sounds like a really sensible approach, a really good habit to get into — ​like regularly flossing your teeth.

the fearful goddess Complexity ... soon showed me the limits of my experience.

good principles like DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself),

I became scared of making changes to my code.

Functional tests as well as unit tests?
TDD test/minimal-code-change/test cycle

the number of times I’ve thought “Thanks, tests”, as a functional test uncovers a regression we would never have predicted, or a unit test saves me from making a really silly logic error. Psychologically, it’s made development a much less stressful process. It produces code that’s a pleasure to work with.

I hope to teach you how to use TDD to get more reliably to our shared, holy goal: clean code that works.

building a web app from scratch using tools like Django, Selenium, jQuery, and Mocks.

Don’t use Django 2 - This book was published before Django 2.0 came out


On Anaconda
Anaconda is another tool for managing different Python environments. It’s particularly *popular on Windows* and for *scientific computing*, where it can be hard to get some of the compiled libraries to install.

In the world of web programming it’s much less necessary, so *I recommend you do not use Anaconda* for this book.
