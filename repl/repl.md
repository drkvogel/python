>You can't do such a thing in the original python interpreter, however, if you use the last version of IPython, it provides a lightweight GUI (looks like a simple shell, but is a GUI in fact) which features multi-line editing, syntax highlighting and a bunch of other things. To use IPython GUI, run it with the ipython qtconsole command.
