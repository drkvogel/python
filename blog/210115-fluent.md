### Fluent Builder Pattern

>a fluent interface is an object-oriented API whose design relies extensively on *method chaining*. Its goal is to increase code legibility by creating a domain-specific language (DSL).

>By returning `self` (the class instance) for every method on the object that modifies attributes, we enable method chaining and therefore implement a fluent interface. This means that rather than setting attributes one line at a time, we can now configure the object in a single line of code and therefore increase the simplicity and readability of our code significantly.

>In my opinion, *fluent APIs are rarely needed in Python*. *Optional keyword arguments* in python allow, in a single function call, to specify a subset of required arguments. For instance, one may argue that this interface is easier to use than fluent API:
```py
ExampleNotFluent(foo="new foo value", bar="bar value", ...)
```
>*Fluent APIs are more convenient in Java* for instance, where keyword arguments are not a thing, and every single argument for every function must be specified:
```java
User.builder().firstName("Spider").lastName("man").city(..).build()
```
