Secrets of addictive games

Simple version: All addictive games need skill, risk and strategy at every moment

But also:
The player must blame themselves for any loss - not the game or its controls
The player must be able to try again - within seconds
There must be progress - the player must be able to see gain for their successes
There must be feedback - the game must respond with graphics and sound when the player does something impressive

multipliers:
Revenge - payback time!
Social/multiplayer/spectators
Time accelerators - let the user skip tedious parts
Humour
